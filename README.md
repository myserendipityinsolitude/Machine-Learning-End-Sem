# Machine-Learning-End-Sem
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) based on various astronomical data. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the model will analyze features such as orbit parameters, size, and composition to identify potential threats to Earth.

Data

The project will utilize a dataset containing information about asteroids, including:

ID: Unique identifier for each asteroid
Name: Asteroid's name
Orbit parameters: Inclination, eccentricity, semi-major axis, etc.
Size and composition: Diameter, albedo, etc.
PHA status: Binary indicator of whether the asteroid is potentially hazardous
Methodology

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers
Normalize or standardize numerical features
Encode categorical features (e.g., using one-hot encoding)
Feature Engineering:
Create new features based on existing data (e.g., calculate the asteroid's closest approach to Earth)
Model Selection and Training:
Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, LGBMClassifier)
Train the selected model on the preprocessed data, optimizing hyperparameters as needed
Evaluation:
Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Consider class imbalance and use techniques like SMOTE to address it
Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for real-time asteroid detection and monitoring
Tools and Technologies

Python programming language
Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment for development and experimentation
Future Work

Explore advanced techniques like deep learning for more complex feature extraction
Integrate real-time data feeds from astronomical observatories
Develop a user interface for visualizing detected PHAs and their trajectories
